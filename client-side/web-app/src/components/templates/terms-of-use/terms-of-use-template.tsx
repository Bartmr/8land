              You acknowledge and agree that cryptography is a progressing
              field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the

              the theft or loss of your cryptographic tokens or property, among
              other potential consequences. By using the Tools you acknowledge

            <p>
              Some Tools allow the use of 8Land NFTs, ETH, or other similar

              NFTs, Ether and blockchain technologies and associated assets, and
              other assets are highly volatile due to many factors including but
              not limited to popularity, adoption, speculation, regulation,
              technology and security risks. You also acknowledge and agree that
              the cost of transacting on such technologies is variable and may
              increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place
              on the Ethereum blockchain. The Project does not invite or make
              any offer to acquire, purchase, sell, transfer or otherwise deal
              in any crypto asset. Third parties may provide services involving

              supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network. Any transfer of a
              8Land NFT occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Ethereum
              network, and not within the Tools.

              6.1 If you elect to purchase, trade, or sell an 8Land territory,
              Avatar, wearable or other non-fungible token (&quot;<b>NFT</b>
              &quot;) with or from other users via the Tools, any financial
              transaction that you engage in will be conducted solely through
              the Ethereum network, Layer 2 solutions or other sidechains via
              Web3 providers. The Project will have no insight into or control
              over these payments or transactions, nor does it have the ability
              to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, the Project will
              have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or
              damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you
              engage in via the Tools, or any other transactions that you
              conduct via the Ethereum network, and other networks, sidechains,

              6.2 Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a &quot;

              Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that
              run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will
              need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the
              Tools. You accept that the payment of the Gas Fee is inherent to
              the nature of the Ethereum network and alien to the Project or due
              to the use of the Tools.

              You shall have a right to terminate your Account at any time by
              canceling and discontinuing your access to and use of the Tools.
              The Project may decide to terminate or suspend all or part of the
              Site and the Tools and your access to the Site and the Tools
              immediately, without prior notice or liability. You will not
              receive any refunds if you cancel your Account, or if these Terms
              are otherwise terminated. You agree that the Project, in its sole
              discretion and for any or no reason, may terminate these Terms and
              suspend your Account(s) for the Tools. You agree that any
              suspension of your access to the Site or the Tools may be without
              prior notice, and that the Project (and its officers and
              employees) will not be liable to you or to any third party for any
              such suspension.

            <p>
              In the event of your breach of these Terms or any suspected
              fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity, the Project may, without
              limitation, suspend your Account, block any infringing Content and
              adopt any other action deemed necessary to prevent future
              breaches, in addition to any other remedies the the Project and/or
              any User may have at law or in equity.

              information to you or to any third party. Upon termination of your

              To the extent possible, the Project may try to reach the would-be
              infringing party to forward your concerns. The Project is not in a
              position to assess the legal merits of the claims.

              As the Project does not control the Content being uploaded by the
              users, if the user does not agree with your claim and/or does not
              accept to withdraw the infringing content, the Project may take
              any of the following measures, (i) block the infringing Content so
              as to render it inaccessible through the Tools (although it could
              be still accessible through other clients); (ii) block the
              infringing user&apos;s Account. Any further action, claim or
              remedy against the infringing user must be undertaken by the
              aggrieved user.
